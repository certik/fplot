! fplot_state - the types and the module state the rest of fplot works on.

! fplot is stateful, as pylab is: there is a current figure and a current
! axes, and every drawing call adds to them. What that state is made of
! lives here, so that the parts of the library that build it and the parts
! that draw it can be read apart from one another.
